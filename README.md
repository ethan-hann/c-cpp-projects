Welcome to my C Project Repository!

Here you will find some of my C related projects that I have worked on over the years. These include personal projects and school projects. See below for descriptions of projects if you don't want to go through the repository :smile:

_Interested in other projects I've worked on not C-related? Check out my other [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/ethan-hann)._

## School Projects
### Spring 2016
* **COSC 2436 - Computer Science II - C++**
  * Appointment Book (_Appointment Book_)  
    A simple appoinment tracker in which you can add, view, and delete appointments.
  
  
### Fall 2017
* **CSCI 4354 - Operating Systems - C**
  * Operating System Memory Manager (_Program 2_)  
    This was the first big programming assignment for my operating systems class. We had to implement a OS memory manager on a server that used paging as its memory allocation scheme.
  
  * CPU Scheduler (_Program 3_)  
    The next project for this class had us implement a short-term round robin CPU scheduler using one server in which multiple clients could connect to.
  
  * CPU and IO Scheduler (_Program 4_)  
    Similar to assignment 3, this one had us add IO scheduling as well.
  
  
### Fall 2018
* **CSCI 4315 - Advanced Programming - C# and .NET**
  * Alarm Clock (_Program 5_)  
    This was a GUI alarm clock written in C# using the .NET framework. It's features include adding and removing alarms as well as snoozing alarms.
